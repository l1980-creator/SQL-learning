# SQL Final Exam â€“ Practice Repository

Welcome to my SQL Final Exam repository. This project contains a collection of SQL exercises and solutions based on exam-style questions. Each task is designed to test and reinforce key concepts in relational databases, including:

- SELECT statements  
- JOIN operations  
- GROUP BY and aggregation  
- Filtering and sorting  
- Subqueries and nested logic

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical SQL skills using real-world scenarios and sample datasets. Each exercise includes a brief description, the SQL query, and a short explanation of the logic behind the solution.

Feel free to explore the tasks, learn from the examples, and use this as a reference for your own SQL practice.
