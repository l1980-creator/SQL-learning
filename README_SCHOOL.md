# 🏫 School Database SQL Queries

Welcome to the **School Database SQL Project** — a hands-on collection of SQL queries designed to explore and manipulate a relational database representing a school system. This repository is ideal for students, educators, and developers looking to learn or teach SQL through practical examples.

---

## 📘 About the Project

This project simulates a school environment with tables such as:

- `students` — student records including names, emails, and class assignments
- `teachers` — teacher profiles with salary data
- `marks` — grades assigned by teachers to students
- `classes` — class groups with assigned main teachers

The queries demonstrate how to retrieve, filter, sort, and insert data using SQL. It also includes examples of common mistakes and how to resolve them.

## 🧪 What’s Inside

### ✅ Basic Queries
- Select all students or teachers
- Retrieve specific columns (e.g., first names, emails)

### 🔍 Filtering with `WHERE`
- Find students whose names start with "A"
- Filter teachers by salary
- Retrieve marks above a certain threshold

### 🔗 Table Relationships
- Use `JOIN` to connect students with their marks
- Find marks given by a specific teacher using their ID

### 🧠 Logical Conditions
- Combine filters with `AND` / `OR`
- Search for students with specific name and surname

### 📊 Sorting with `ORDER BY`
- Sort marks from highest to lowest
- Alphabetically order students by surname

### ✍️ Data Insertion
- Add new teachers and handle primary key constraints
- Insert new classes and assign teachers
- Add multiple students in a single query

### ⚠️ Error Handling
- Examples of constraint violations (e.g., duplicate keys, null values)
- How to resolve insertion errors by adjusting query structure

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is built to:
- Teach SQL fundamentals through real-world examples
- Provide a sandbox for experimenting with relational data
- Help users understand how tables relate and interact

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run these queries, you’ll need:
- A SQL-compatible database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- A schema with tables: `students`, `teachers`, `marks`, `classes`
- Basic familiarity with SQL syntax

You can copy and paste the queries into your SQL console or integrate them into your own database project.

---

## 💡 Tips

- Always check for existing primary keys before inserting new records
- Use `JOIN` to unlock powerful cross-table insights
- Practice writing queries with different conditions to deepen your understanding
